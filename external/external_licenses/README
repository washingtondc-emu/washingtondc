This directory is used for storing some of the licenses that belong
to external dependencies of WashingtonDC.

When possible, WashingtonDC's root CMakeLists.txt will copy a license
file directly from a dependency.  There are, however, a couple dependencies
whose licenses are not contained in a single dedicated file and are instead
part of another file which primarily serves a different purpose; eg some
libraries will only include the license in their README file or only include
it in comment lines in code.  In this case, we store those licenses in the
external_licenses directories so that CMakeLists.txt can copy them to
the output directory when installing or packaging.
