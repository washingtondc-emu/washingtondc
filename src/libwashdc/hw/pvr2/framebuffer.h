/*
 * HOKAY:
 *
 * This is a lot to think about but we're gonna get through it, folks:
 *
 * the PVR2 will do all its calcualtions as ARGB8888
 * When it writes the output to the framebuffer, it does that in whatever
 * format was specified in the FB_W_CTRL register (although apparently you can't
 * use the 4444 ARGB mode unless rendering to a texture?).  THEN, when the data
 * is being sent to the CRT, it gets converted to 888RGB + chroma bit ?
 *
 * ANYWAYS
 * The algorithm we're going to go with here is:
 * 1. Use OpenGL to handle any fancy 3D PVR2 renderings
 * 2. When the CPU attempts to read from/write to the framebuffer, we shall
 *    first read from the OpenGL color buffer using PBOs and store that in the
 *    Dreamcast's framebuffer
 * 3. If the user then attempts to perform some PVR2 3D rendering, we will then
 *    take the Dreamcast's framebuffer, upload it to an OpenGL texture and
 *    render that texture as a quad which encompasses the entire rendering
 *    area.  Depth buffer writes will be disabled during this pass.
 * 4. WHEN THE VBLANK INTERRUPT ARRIVES, we will copy the OpenGL color buffer
 *    to the DC framebuffer if the DC framebuffer is not the latest version of
 *    what has been rendered.  We will then render the DC framebuffer to the
 *    screen as a textured quad that encompasses the entire screen.
 *
 * This algorithm is not particularly high-performance (especially since we
 * always copy the OpenGL color buffer to framebuffer regardless of whether
 * it's necessary), but it is realatively simple and it avoids the need for
 * some sort of special case in the final output stage.  Right now, performance
 * takes a backseat to basic functionality.
 *
 * The FB_R_CTRL and FB_R_SOF1/FB_R_SOF2 registers control settings for the
 * framebuffer->CRT transfer; the FB_W_CTRL and FB_W_SOF1/FB_W_SOF2 registers
 * control settings for the PVR2->framebuffer transfer.
