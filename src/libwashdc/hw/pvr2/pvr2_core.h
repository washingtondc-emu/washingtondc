/*
 * On a real Dreamcast, the CPU creates in GPU VRAM a per-tile array which
 * contains pointers to lists of polygon data for each of the five polygon
 * groups.  This tile array is pointed to by the PVR2_REGION_BASE register,
 * and the pointers to the five polygon groups are offset by the
 * PVR2_PARAM_BASE registero.  When the STARTRENDER command is issued, the GPU
 * reads in each tile from the tile array (pointed to by PVR2_REGION_BASE), and
 * then for each tile it renders the polygon data pointed to by the 5 polygon
 * group pointers (after adding the PVR2_REGION_BASE register to those
 * pointers).
 *
 * The TA creates the polygon data but it has no knowledge of the tile array.
 * Instead it has its own control registers which point it to where in GPU
 * memory polygon data should be written.  These registers are configured by
 * the CPU in a way that ought to be consistent with what's in the tile array.
 *
 * The tile array allows tiles to be laid out in-memory in any order.  I'm not
 * 100% sure on this but I think that the TA assumes they're laid out in a
 * sensible row-major order (thus restricting the layout to row-major unless
 * the CPU wants to generate its own display lists without the TA's help).
 *
 * The PVR2_TA_VERTBUF_POS register points to where the TA should start writing
 * polygon data.  So it corresponds to the PVR2_REGION_BASE register, so it's
 * *hopefully* safe to use this as a key for tracking display lists.  So our
 * HLE strategy here is keep track of the last PVR2_MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT values
 * of PVR2_TA_VERTBUF_POS that were used, and replay those TAFIFO inputs
 * whenever we see a STARTRENDER command with a matching PVR2_REGION_BASE.  This
 * will be faster and easier to implement than a real LLE of the display list
 * format, albeit less accurate.
 *
 * Potential failure cases include:
 * * there are more than PVR2_MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT frames in flight - it is
 *   extremely unlikely that anybody would ever use more than two, but if they
 *   really want to fuck with me by doing this then they can.
 * * PVR2_TA_VERTBUF_POS doesn't match PVR2_REGION_BASE, but the pointers in
 *   the tile array still line up with where the TA put the data - this is very
 *   possible but thankfully it never seems to be the case in any of the logs I
 *   have looked at.
 * * software generated its own display lists without using the TA - very
 *   possible but I seriously doubt anything actually does this.  If this case
 *   is ever encountered then true low-level display list emulation is the only
 *   possible solution.
 * * The game queued up more data then I have room to buffer - this is very
 *   avoidable even in the worst-case scenario since a modern PC can easily have
 *   thousands of times more memory than the Dreamcast's VRAM.
 *
 * I'm also not entirely sure how list continuation will need to be handled as
 * a special case, but hopefully the answer is "it won't".
